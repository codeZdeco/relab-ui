<h1 align="center">Relab UI</h1>

Inspired by [MUI](https://mui.com/), we develop a library Relab-UI that allows users to simply pass in a set of predefined APIs to create a common component.  
Some available components that have created by so far:

- Table
- Context Menu
- Form
- Resize Area
- Scroll Area
- Tree View

## Installation

Relab UI is available as npm package

```
// with npm
npm install @codezdeco/relab-ui

// with yarn
yarn add @codezdeco/relab-ui
```
